/// TODO: Architectural Issue - Mutable Event Payloads
/// Currently, events pass mutable Job objects by reference.
/// This causes race conditions for async consumers (like the local CLI progress reporter), 
/// because the Job's properties (like ResolvedTarget) can mutate before the consumer processes the event.
/// The Server/Remote CLI mode mitigates this by immediately projecting the Job into an immutable DTO 
/// on the publisher thread, effectively taking a snapshot. In the future, the core DownloadEvents
/// should be refactored to pass immutable state snapshots rather than live Job references.
