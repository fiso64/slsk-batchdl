# sldl

A smart and configurable downloader for Soulseek. Built with Soulseek.NET.

### Features

- Accepts various input sources like CSV files, Spotify or YouTube URLs, or standard text queries
- Can download individual songs, playlists, albums, or even full artist discographies
- Intelligently selects the best album or song based on user configuration and heuristics
- For those who don't trust full auto selection, album downloads can be [interactive](#shortcuts--interactive-mode). The best results will be listed first.
- Special "aggregate" modes which can list all distinct songs or albums by a given artist available on Soulseek, sorted by popularity
- Can skip downloading songs or albums found in a given music directory
- Configuration profiles and auto profiles
- Arbitratry name formatting for downloaded files
- On-complete commands that can run when a download succeeds or fails

## Setup

1. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/fiso64/slsk-batchdl/releases) page and get an appropriate release for your system.
2. Put your soulseek username and password in the [configuration file](#configuration).
3. Try it:
    ```bash
    sldl "Artist - Your Favorite Album" -at
    ```
    This will search for the album and show an interactive UI for result selection.  
    For more examples, see the [usage examples section](#examples-2).

> [!NOTE]
> `sldl` itself doesn't share your music folders. To keep the Soulseek network healthy over the long term, please also share your collection using a regular client like [Nicotine+](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus) or [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd).  
> It is recommended to use `sldl` with a **separate Soulseek account** to avoid connection problems.

#### Search Options
```
--fast-search                   Begin downloading as soon as a file satisfying the preferred
                                conditions is found. Only for normal download mode.

                                Optionally specify a replacement regex after a semicolon.
                                Add 'T:', 'A:' or 'L:' at the start to only apply this to
                                the track title, artist, or album respectively.
--artist-maybe-wrong            Performs an additional search without the artist name.
                                Useful for sources like SoundCloud where the "artist"
                                could just be an uploader. Note that when downloading a
                                YouTube playlist via url, this option is set automatically
                                on a per-track basis, so it is best kept off in that case.
-d, --desperate                 Tries harder to find the desired track by searching for the
                                artist/album/title only, then filtering. (slower search)

--yt-dlp-argument <str>         The command line arguments when running yt-dlp. Default:
                                "{id}" -f bestaudio/best -cix -o "{savepath}.%(ext)s"
                                Available vars are: {id}, {savedir}, {savepath} (w/o ext).
                                Note that -x causes yt-dlp to download webms in case ffmpeg
                                is unavailable.

--search-timeout <ms>           Max search time in ms (default: 6000)

<!-- sldl-help:end -->

<!-- sldl-help:start(input) -->
## Input types
The input type is usually determined automatically. You can also manually set it with `--input-type`.  
The following input types are available:

###  CSV file
Path to a local CSV file. Use a csv file containing track information to download a list of
songs or albums. Only the title or album column is required, but extra info may improve search
result ranking. If the columns have common names ('Artist', 'Title', 'Album', 'Length', etc)
then it's not required to manually specify them, otherwise you must provide at least `--title-col` or `--album-col`.   
Rows that do not have any text in the title column will be treated as album downloads.

###  YouTube
A YouTube playlist url. Download songs from a youtube playlist.  
**Note:** The default method to retrieve playlists might not reliably return all videos. To get all
videos, you can use the official API by providing a key with `--youtube-key`. A key can
be obtained at https://console.cloud.google.com. Create a new project, click 'Enable Api' and
search for 'youtube data', then follow the prompts.

### Spotify
Any playlist or album url, or `spotify-likes` for your liked songs, or `spotify-albums` for liked albums.  
Credentials are required when downloading a private playlist or liked music.

#### Using Credentials

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

Create a Spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications with a redirect url http://127.0.0.1:48721/callback. Obtain an application ID and secret from the created application dashboard.

Start sldl with the obtained credentials and an authorized action to trigger the Spotify app login flow:

```
sldl spotify-likes --spotify-id 123456 --spotify-secret 123456 -n 1 --print-tracks
```
sldl will try to open a browser automatically but will fallback to logging the login flow URL to output. After login flow is complete sldl will output a token and refresh token and finish running the current command.

To skip requiring login flow every time sldl is used the token and refresh token can be provided to sldl (hint: store this info in the config file to make commands less verbose):

```
sldl spotify-likes --spotify-id 123456 --spotify-secret 123456 --spotify-refresh 123456 --spotify-token 123456 -n 1 --pt
```

spotify-token access is only valid for 1 hour. spotify-refresh will enable sldl to renew access every time it is run (and can be used without including spotify-token)
</details>

### Bandcamp
A bandcamp track, album, or artist url. Download a single track, an album, or an artist's
entire discography.

### MusicBrainz
A MusicBrainz.org URL for a release, release group, or collection.
- A `/release/...` URL is treated as a single album download with a strict track count.
- A `/release-group/...` URL is also treated as a single album download. It tries to pick the most common version of the album. Sets the minimum album track count to the chosen release track count, and no maximum track count unless `--extract-max-track-count` is set.
- A `/collection/...` URL is treated as a list of albums, downloading each release contained within the collection.

### Soulseek Link
A direct path starting with `slsk://`. Paths ending in `/` will be treated as album downloads.

### Search string
Name of the track, album, or artist to search for. The input can either be an arbitrary
search string (like what you would type in the soulseek search bar), or a comma-separated
list of properties of the form `title=Song Name, artist=Artist Name, length=215`.

The following properties are accepted: title, artist, album, length (in seconds), 
artist-maybe-wrong, album-track-count.

String input accepts a shorthand for track and album downloads: The input `ARTIST - TITLE`
will be parsed as `artist=ARTIST, title=TITLE` when downloading songs, and
`artist=ARTIST, album=TITLE` when run with `--album`.

### List file
List input must be manually activated with `--input-type=list`. The input must be a path to a text
file containing lines of the following form:
```ini
# Any input type                conditions (optional)           pref. conditions (optional)
"Artist - Song"                 "format=mp3; br>128"            "br >= 320"

# Album download shorthand:
a:"Artist - Album"              format=flac
# Add strict-* conditions depending on the name 
a:"Another Album"               strict-album=true
```
The inputs can be any of the above input types, including links. The conditions are added on top of the
configured conditions and can be omitted. 
<!-- sldl-help:end -->

<!-- sldl-help:start(download-modes) -->
## Download modes
### Normal
The default for playlists. Downloads a single file for every input entry.

### Album
sldl will search for the album and download an entire folder including non-audio
files. Activated when the input is a link to a spotify or bandcamp album, when the input
string or csv row has no track title, or when `-a/--album` is enabled.

### Aggregate
With `-g/--aggregate`, sldl performs an ordinary search for the input, then attempts to
group the results into distinct songs and download one of each, starting with the one shared
by the most users. Note that `--min-shares-aggregate` is 2 by default, meaning that songs
shared by only one user will be ignored. Aggregate mode can be used to download all songs by 
an artist.  

### Album Aggregate
Activated when both `--album` and `--aggregate` are enabled. sldl will group shares and
download one of each distinct album, starting with the one shared by the most users. Note
that `--min-shares-aggregate` is 2 by default, meaning that albums shared by only one user
will be ignored. Album-aggregate mode can be used to download the most popular (or all) albums
by an artist. It is recommended to pair it with `--interactive`.
<!-- sldl-help:end -->

<!-- sldl-help:start(config) -->
## Configuration
### Config Location
sldl will look for a file named sldl.conf in the following locations:

- `~/AppData/Roaming/sldl/sldl.conf`
- `~/.config/sldl/sldl.conf`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sldl/sldl.conf`
- `{sldl executable dir}/sldl.conf`

### Syntax
Example config file:
```ini
username = your-username
password = your-password
pref-format = flac
fast-search = true
```
Lines starting with hashtags # will be treated as comments. Tildes in paths are expanded as the user
directory (even on windows). The path variable `{bindir}` stores the directory of the sldl binary.

### Configuration profiles
Profiles are supported:
```ini
[lossless]
pref-format = flac,wav
```
To activate the above profile, run `--profile lossless`. To list all available profiles,
run `--profile help`.  
Profiles can be activated automatically based on a few simple conditions:
```ini
# never automatically cancel album downloads in interactive mode
[no-stale]
profile-cond = interactive && download-mode == "album"
max-stale-time = 9999999

# download to another location for youtube
[youtube]
profile-cond = input-type == "youtube"
path = ~/downloads/sldl-youtube
```
The following operators are supported for use in profile-cond: &&, ||, ==, !=, !{bool}.  
The following variables are available:
```
input-type        ("youtube"|"csv"|"string"|"bandcamp"|"spotify")
download-mode     ("normal"|"aggregate"|"album"|"album-aggregate")
interactive       (bool)
```
<!-- sldl-help:end -->

<!-- sldl-help:start(file-conditions) -->
## File conditions
Files not satisfying the required conditions will be ignored. Files satisfying pref-conditions
will be preferred: With `--pref-format flac,wav`, sldl will try to download lossless files if
available while still accepting lossy files.

There are no default required conditions. The default preferred conditions are:
```ini
pref-format = mp3
pref-length-tol = 3
pref-min-bitrate = 200
pref-max-bitrate = 2500
pref-max-samplerate = 48000
pref-strict-title = true
pref-strict-album = true
```
sldl will therefore prefer mp3 files with bitrate between 200 and 2500 kbps, and whose length
differs from the supplied length by no more than 3 seconds. Moreover, it will prefer files
whose paths contain the supplied title and album. Changing the last two preferred conditions is
not recommended.  

Note that files satisfying only a subset of the conditions will be preferred over files that don't
satisfy any condition. Run a search with `--print results-full` to reveal the sorting logic.

Conditions can also be supplied as a semicolon-delimited string with `--cond` and `--pref`, e.g
`--cond "br>=320; format=mp3,ogg; sr<96000"`.

### Note on availability of metadata
Some info may be unavailable depending on the client used by the peer. If (e.g) `--min-bitrate`
is set, then sldl will still accept any file with unknown bitrate. To reject all files where one
or more of the checked properties is null (unknown), enable `--strict-conditions`.  

This flag should be used with care: It's easy to accidentally exclude all files from users with
certain clients. For example, because the standard Soulseek client does not broadcast the bitrate,
enabling `--strict-conditions` and setting a `--min-bitrate` will make sldl ignore all files
shared by users with the standard client. Even without a required min-bitrate, all those shares
will be ranked at the bottom due to the default pref- bitrate checks.

<!-- sldl-help:start(name-format) -->
## Name format
Variables enclosed in {} will be replaced by the corresponding file tag value.
Name format supports subdirectories as well as conditional expressions like {tag1|tag2} - If
tag1 is null, use tag2. This can be chained arbitrarily many times. String literals enclosed
in parentheses are ignored in the null check.

### Examples
- `{artist} - {title}`  
    Always name it 'Artist - Title'. Because some files on Soulseek are untagged, the
    following is generally preferred:
- `{artist( - )title|filename}`  
    If artist and title are not null, name it 'Artist - Title', otherwise use the original
    filename.
- `{albumartist(/)album(/)track(. )title|(missing-tags/)slsk-foldername(/)slsk-filename}`  
    Sort files into artist/album folders if all tags are present, otherwise put them in
    the 'missing-tags' folder.   

### Available variables

The following values are read from the downloaded file's tags:
```

<!-- sldl-help:start(on-complete) -->
## On-Complete Actions
The `--on-complete` parameter allows executing commands after a track or album is downloaded. Multiple actions can be chained using the `+ ` prefix (note the space after +).

**Syntax:** `--on-complete [prefixes:]command`

### Prefixes
- `1:` - Execute only if track downloaded successfully
- `2:` - Execute only if track failed to download
- `a:` - Execute only after album download
- `s:` - Use shell execute
- `h:` - Hide window
- `r:` - Read command output
- `u:` - Use output to update index (implies `r:`)

When using u: prefix, the command output should be `new_state;new_path` to update the track state and path in the index and playlist.

### Variables

The available variables are the same as in name-format, with the following additions:
- `{exitcode}` - Previous command's exit code
- `{stdout}` - Previous command's stdout (requires r:)
- `{stderr}` - Previous command's stderr (requires r:)
- `{first-exitcode}` - First command's exit code
- `{first-stdout}` - First command's stdout (requires r:)
- `{first-stderr}` - First command's stderr (requires r:)

### Examples

The following examples are for Windows, but can be easily adapted for any OS.  
  
Search album art with [Cover Fetcher](https://github.com/fiso64/cover-fetcher):
```ini
on-complete = 1:h:a: cmd /c start "" "path\to\CoverFetcher.exe" --from-dir "{path}"
```

Queue downloaded audio files in foobar2000:
```ini
on-complete = 1:h: cmd /c if {is-audio}==true start "" "path\to\foobar2000.exe" /immediate /add "{path}"
```

Convert downloaded audio files to MP3 (requires ffmpeg):
```ini
# Check if file is audio and not already MP3
on-complete =   1:h:r: cmd /c if {is-audio}==true if /i not {ext}==.mp3 if not exist "{path-noext}.mp3" echo true

# Convert to MP3 if check passed
on-complete = + 1:h:r: cmd /c if {stdout}==true (ffmpeg -i "{path}" -q:a 0 "{path-noext}.mp3" && echo success)

# Delete original and update index if conversion succeeded
on-complete = + 1:h:u: cmd /c if {stdout}==success (del "{path}" & echo "1;{path-noext}.mp3")
```

## Shortcuts & interactive mode
### Shortcuts
To cancel a running album download, press `C`.

### Interactive mode
Interactive mode for albums can be enabled with `-t`/`--interactive`. It enables users to choose the desired folder or download specific files from it.

Key bindings:
```
Up/p            previous folder
Down/n          next folder
Enter/d         download selected folder
y               download folder and disable interactive mode
r               retrieve all files in the folder
s               skip current item
Esc/q           quit program
h               print this help text

d:1,2,3         download specific files
d:start-end     download a range of files
f:query         filter folders containing files matching query
cd ..           load parent folder
cd subdir       go to subfolder
```
<!-- sldl-help:end -->

## Examples

Download tracks from a csv file:
```bash
sldl "tracks.csv"
```
<br>

Download a Spotify playlist, or your liked songs:
```bash
sldl "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/id"
sldl "spotify-likes"
```

<br>

Download the albums of a spotify playlist:
```bash
sldl "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/id" -a
```

<br>

Download a youtube playlist, retrieving deleted video names and with yt-dlp fallback:
```bash
sldl "https://youtube.com/playlist/id" --get-deleted --yt-dlp
```

<br>

Interactive album download, only show albums with 13 or more tracks:
```bash
sldl "Album Name" -at --atc 13+
```

<br>

Download a specific song by name and length, preferring lossless:
```bash
sldl "MC MENTAL @ HIS BEST, length=242" --pref-format "flac,wav"
``` 

<br>

Download all albums by an artist interactively:
```bash
sldl "artist=MC MENTAL" -a -g -t
```

<br>

Print all songs by an artist which are not in your library:
```bash
sldl "artist=MC MENTAL" -g --skip-music-dir "path/to/music" --print results
```

### Advanced example: Automatic wishlist downloader
Create a file named `wishlist.txt`, and add some items as detailed in [Input types: List](#list-file):
```
"Artist - My Favorite Song"            format=flac
a:"Artist - Some Album"                strict-album=true;album-track-count=5
```
Add a profile to your `sldl.conf`:
```ini
[wishlist]
input = ~/sldl/wishlist.txt 
input-type = list
index-path = ~/sldl/wishlist-index.sldl
album-parallel-search = true
```
This will create a global index file `wishlist-index.sldl` which will be scanned every time sldl is run to skip wishlist items that have already been downloaded. If you want to continue searching until a version satisfying the preferred conditions is found, also add `skip-check-pref-cond = true` (note that this requires the files to remain in the same spot after being downloaded).  

Now you can manually run, or set up a cron job / scheduled task to periodically run sldl with the following option:
```bash
sldl --profile wishlist
```

## Notes
- **Terminal display issues**: The printed output may appear duplicated, overlap, or not update on some configurations (new windows terminal, git bash). Use another terminal or `--no-progress` in case of issues. See https://github.com/fiso64/slsk-batchdl/issues/55.
- **Soulseek's rate limits**: The server bans users for 30 minutes if too many searches are performed within a short timespan. sldl has a search limiter which can be adjusted with `--searches-per-time` and `--searches-renew-time` (when the limit is reached, the status of the downloads will be 'Waiting'). By default it is configured to allow up to 34 searches every 220 seconds.

## Tips

### Searching

- Just like in other soulseek clients, it's always best to provide the least input in the search string necessary to uniquely identify an album or song.
  - Use `--remove-ft` to remove "feat." or "ft." artists 
  - For spotify or bandcamp albums, you can remove the artist name with `--regex A:.*`.
- You can download an entire album based on the name of one of its songs by searching for that name with `-a/--album`. 
- When searching for a single song with a string input, you can provide the album name in addition. The album name will not be included in the query, but search results containing it will be preferred (due to pref-strict-album).
- When dealing with YouTube playlists you may want to remove any text in parentheses (like (Video)), as well as "Official" and "Lyrics" with `--regex "[\[\(].*?[\]\)]|(?i:lyrics)|(?i:official)"` 

### Filtering Irrelevant Results

sldl typically selects the correct files as long as they appear in the search results. By default, it always tries to download something and does no additional filtering. However, you can use the following options to filter your search results:

- `--strict-title`, `--strict-artist`, `--strict-album`  
  Filters out files whose paths do not include the specified title, artist, or album name (ignoring case and using boundary characters). Because the pref- versions of these options are enabled by default, they are only recommended when you want to reduce false downloads, e.g. for [wishlists](#advanced-example-automatic-wishlist-downloader) where there is a high probability that the item does not exist on the network.

- `--length-tol`  
  For normal downloads, this option sets a tolerance level by which the file’s length can differ from the input length. The default preference (--pref-length-tol) is set to 3 seconds.

- `--album-track-count`  
  When downloading an album, you can specify this option to ensure the album contains a certain number of tracks. For instance, if the input is a Spotify or Bandcamp album, this field is automatically set to `n+` (where n is the number of tracks on the album). This ensures that only albums with at least n tracks are accepted (useful when there are more complete versions of the album on soulseek).


### Speeding things up
The following options will make it go faster, but may decrease search result quality or cause instability:

- `--fast-search` skips waiting until the search completes and downloads as soon as a file matching the preferred conditions is found
- `--concurrent-downloads` can be set it to 4 or more. This only affects normal downloads (not album).
- `--max-stale-time` is set to 30 seconds by default, sldl will wait a long time before giving up on a file.
- `--album-parallel-search` enables parallel searching for album entries

<!-- sldl-help:end -->

## Docker

A docker container for running `sldl` can be built from this repository. The image supports linux x86/ARM. 

To build and start container:

```shell
clone https://github.com/fiso64/slsk-batchdl
cd slsk-batchdl
docker compose up -d
```

`exec` into the container to start using `sldl`:

```shell
docker compose exec sldl sh
sldl --help
```

The compose stack mounts two directories relative to where `docker-compose.yml` is located which can be used for file management:

* `/config` (at `./config` on host) - put your `sldl.conf` [configuration](#configuration-) in this directory and then use `sldl -c /config ...` to use your configuration in the container
* `/data` (at `./data` on host) - use as the download directory IE `sldl -p /data ...`

### File Permissions

If you are running Docker on a **Linux Host** you should specify `user:group` permissions of the user who owns the **configuration and data directory** on the host to avoid [docker file permission problems.](https://ikriv.com/blog/?p=4698) These can be specified using the [environmental variables **PUID** and **PGID**.](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid)

To get the UID and GID for the current user run these commands from a terminal:

* `id -u` -- prints UID
* `id -g` -- prints GID

Replace these with the corresponding variable (`PUID` `PGID`) in `docker-compose.yml`.


### Cron

One or more `sldl` commands can be run on a schedule using [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) built into the container.

To create a schedule make a new file on the host `./config/crontabs/abc` and use it with the standard [crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) syntax.

Make sure to restart the container after any changes to the cron file are made.

Example => Run `sldl` every Sunday at 1am, search for missing tracks from the specified Spotify playlist

```
# min   hour    day     month   weekday command
0 1 * * 0 sldl https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sf1WR5grXGJ6dET -c /config -p /data --index-path /data/index.sldl
```

[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) could be used to help with the scheduling expression.
